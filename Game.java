/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "World of Zuul" application, which is used as a base. 
 *  "The Death of Catacombs" is a text based adventure game. There is a maze in which
 *  you have to find the exit. The player is given hints throughout the game to help them guide the exit.
 *  Be careful making decisions because you use up a fuel bar every time you enter a different room.
 *  If your fuel bar is exhausted to zero, then the game is over and you lose.
 * 
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
